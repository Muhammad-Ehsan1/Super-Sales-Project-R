Than using R base function I import dataset from local storage. Then I see the DataSet. Than I see the no of rows & column of DataSet. Then I show it columns datatypes, count of variable in column. Than I show no of null values in all columns. Than I show the summary of dataset. Then I show the total sales of SuperStore. Then I show the average profit of a SuperStore. Then I show the average sales by product category. Then I show the average sales by sub-category. Then I show the top 10 most buying sub-category. Then I show top 10 cities which has most sales.
